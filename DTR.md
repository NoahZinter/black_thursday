### Guiding Questions to Define The Relationship:

* What are each of our learning goals for this project? What drives us in this project?

  * Understand all of the code (everyone, all of the code)
  * Understand file IO (input/output)
  * Learn more about OOP and design (make a well-structured code base)
  * Group coordination: Learn how to guide/facilitate group interactions
  * Learn to work with a team and enforce personal boundaries

* What is your collaboration style? How do you feel about pair programming vs. divide-and-conquer approaches?

  * Both are important
  * Independent time is important, but should be able to ask for help, clarification, etc. from the group
  * Adding independent resources to the issue can help everyone get up to speed
  * Thorough and explicit planning for the whole is important (as a group)
  * Planning is CRITICAL: flow charts, class descriptions w/variables and methods, etc.
  * Resource: Jamboard

* How do you communicate best? How do you appreciate receiving communication from others?

  * Slack for Turing communication!
  * Post code issues/questions to the group thread in Slack
  * In a paired room -- put outlying issues in slack (maybe also put notes in the PR in GitHub; tag with HelpWanted or Question in GitHub)
  * If you see a HelpWanted tag in Issues, we can review, work through that as a group.
  * Team standups! No more than 15 mins. Check ins, daily tasks, blockers.
  * Team sitdowns! End of the day, also short. Meeting notes go in Slack.

* How would you describe your work style?

  * To start, we're going to check in at 30 minutes and consider a break. If no break needed, let's keep working.
  * After Monday, we can reassess and decide whether this is functional.

* What are each of our strengths? How can our strengths complement each other?

* What’s gone well or poorly in your previous projects?

  * Well
    * Breaks are important!
    * Independent research time is key
    * If you're stuck on something for more than 30-45 minutes, STOP! Get up and walk away. Take a break. Take a walk. DO IT.
    * Ask for help regularly and without judgement
    * Re-DTR/Retro on Friday

  * Poorly
    * Not enough sleep, breaks
    * Needed more rest, independent work time

* How will we set direction and make decisions as a team?

  * Making milestones in GitHub to communicate direction
  * Pre-planning an end goal for the project with specs on class interactions and overall structure
  * Norming around final decision making. We should have an overall democratic structure, but may need to resolve conflicts.

* How will we overcome obstacles?
* What do you need (resources, environment, communication) to do your best work?
* What scheduling restraints do you have? What are your scheduling preferences?

  * Noah: No group coding after 6pm Tuesdays, good to work up to 6-7pm after class, can work mornings, no coding Saturday 10-11am MST
  * Sami: Central Timezone (+1 to MST), no coding after 8pm MST (9pm CST)
  * Richard: No coding after 9pm, early mornings are tough (if needed 1 hour coding the AM), 6-7pm is dinnertime
  * Molly: No coding after 9pm, can code after 7:30am or so

  * Group:
    * Everyone take the time they need for non-project Turing work
    * Stop coding at 8pm MST as a group (independent work may be different)
    * Weekends: will plan specific schedules out later, but generally will only work during reasonable daytime hours, 4-6 hours maximum per day
    * Make page on the Jamboard for scheduling

* What is your style for giving feedback? Does anything ever hold you back from giving feedback?



* What do you identify as being your biggest strength(s) technically, as they relate to this project? Where do you feel you could use improvement in your technical skills, as they relate to this project? How can our team help support you in improving these skills?



* What tools do you want to use to manage the project?

  * GitHub project manager
  * Slack
  * GitHub issues (let's all create these!) - these are for individual PRs, smaller 'chunks' of work that complete tasks
  * Milestones are made up of many issues. Milestones are complete when all the issues are complete.

* How do you want the group to solve problems when members run into issues with features of the project?

  * If two people disagree, the other two group members can help with mediating that conflict.
  * If we have a whole group disagreement, we understand that we all need to come together and collaborate on a solution.

* How do you know if a project is successful? How can we achieve that as a group?
* How will we recognize each other's successes and celebrate them?

Any additional questions that you would like to add:

### Remote Work Considerations During the COVID-19 Quarantine
* What does remote focus look like for you? (headphones, distractions minimized (tv, family stuff, etc), video on)
* When working from the same place where you live, life can get in the way. What are some potential life things that could affect your ability to focus, and what plan can we come up with to approach those moments?
* If we encounter issues such as power outages, Zoom difficulties, or bad wifi, what backup plans can we have in place? (This could have answers like  asking a neighbor to borrow wifi, using cellphone hotspot for internet, switching to slack or skype.
* Pomodoro breaks are especially important for remote work and doubly so for quarantine. What should our Pom cadence look like? How will hold ourselves accountable?
* Quarantine is tough, so it’s important to make note of our mental/emotional state when working with others. How can we make space to check in on each other’s well being, in addition to the work that needs to be done?
